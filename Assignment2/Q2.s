# given n, k find the sum of factorials of all fibonacci numbers upto n and return sum % k by taking modulo in each step
# The number n and k will be stored in register %rbx and %rcx respectively
# Store the final answer in %rdx
# Ensure that overflow doesnâ€™t occur by taking appropriate modulo operations at each stage.
# As the problem involves multiple repeated operations, it is suggested to write procedures for the different operations.
# 1 and 2 have to be taken as first two fibonacci numbers
